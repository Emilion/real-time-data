# Real Time Data - demo app

Real time data demo app was required by Relay42.

## Description

For more info about [Client](https://github.com/Emilion/real-time-data/tree/master/client)

For more info about [Server](https://github.com/Emilion/real-time-data/tree/master/server)

## Specifics

* The server handle one client connection.
* Server needs to be started before the Client, otherwise you`ll need to refresh the client because
the client establish the connection on initial load.

* Once web-socket is opened it could be broken by refreshing the client. (no error handling on server side)

## Features

* Chart axis scales could be dynamically changed regarding current ticks values.
